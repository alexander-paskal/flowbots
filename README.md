# Introduction
This repo is all about optical flow. We are reimplementing FlowNet and FlowNet2 from scratch in Pytorch, as well as a Transformer-based version of FlowNet.
# Installation
All code was run in a conda environment. To replicate the exact environment, run the following commands in the Anaconda prompt:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

    conda activate flowbots

For more information on installing conda environments, see https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file. Alternatively, the minimum essential packages are included in a requirements.txt file. This can be installed using pip

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Datasets

We use the following datasets:

- Flying Chairs
- Flying Things 3D

## Flying Chairs

The FlyingChairs dataset must be downloaded and organized in the following manner:

    root
        FlyingChairs
            data
                00001_flow.flo
                00001_img1.ppm
                00001_img2.ppm
                ...
            FlyingChairs_train_val.txt

The root file must be designated in the accompanying config.json file by setting the "flying_chairs" field
